# SAI 1.9.1 Release Notes

The Switch Abstraction Interface(SAI) defines the APIs to provide a vendor-independent way of controlling forwarding elements, such as a switching ASIC, an NPU or a software switch in a uniform manner. This release document covers the SAI API changes from SAI tag 1.8.1 to SAI tag 1.9.1. The previous release notes corresponding to SAI tag 1.8.1 is available at [SAI 1.8.1 release notes](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/blob/master/doc/SAI_1.8.1_ReleaseNotes.md) 

This document explains the new SAI features as well as the enhancements and the bug fixes on existing features. 


### Class-Based Forwarding 

This PR defines class-based forwarding. It contains two aspects:

	* Assignment of a Forwarding Class to a packet, via QOS map or ACL
	* New next-hop group type: SAI_NEXT_HOP_GROUP_TYPE_CLASS_BASED

Where member selection is based on the forwarding-class of the packet. saiacl is updated with new type def SAI_ACL_ENTRY_ATTR_ACTION_SET_FORWARDING_CLASS and sainexthopgroup.h with SAI_NEXT_HOP_GROUP_TYPE_CLASS_BASED

### Adding IPsec support

A new API saiipsec.h has been added part of this current release. For more detail, please refer to [SAI IPsec API](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/doc/IPsec/SAI_IPsec_API_proposal.md) doc 

The PR related to this feature is available at PR#[1206](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/pull/1206)


### Updates to SRv6 programming model and related objects/attributes

This implementation will bring SRv6 APIs and attributes in-line with the latest RFCs and SAI MPLS/tunnel pipeline model Also, this implementation doesn't explicitly address the functionality related to Traffic Class, Hop-Limit, ECN marking and load-balancing hash calculation. It's assumed that existing attributes for other IPv6 tunnels will apply to the SRv6 as well.

There are few changes in following API's sainexthop.h, saiobject.h, saisegmentroute.h,  saisrv6.h, saiswitch.h, saitunnel.h and saitypes.h for this implementation

### New attribute to start fw broadcast process 

This additional attribute is to support 5-step FW broadcast process. This attribute is only applicable to PHY and its valid when broadcast is enabled. This is mainly used when the design has multiple PHYs and user would like to take advantage of broadcast FW download to save MDIO cycles and time.

 /**
     * @brief Slave MDIO Address list
     *
     * Configure list of slave MDIO addresses for firmware download in Broadcast mode.
     * The sequence for firmware download in broadcast mode is as follows:
     * 1. For each MDIO master, call sai_create_switch() and pass the list of slave MDIO addresses.
     * In this step, gearbox will upgrade the firmware on all PHY devices including master and slave.
     *
     * 2. Call sai_create_switch() on all slave PHY devices with #SAI_SWITCH_ATTR_FIRMWARE_LOAD_TYPE = SAI_SWITCH_FIRMWARE_LOAD_TYPE_SKIP,
     * which will already have had their firmware upgraded.

### Add support for programming My MAC table separately from RIF

RIF Source MAC is used to set the Source MAC address in transmitted packet. It can also be used to match the Destination MAC address in received packet. This proposal provides the capability to program the MAC address used in the receive path.

### Assign values to enum fields

This implementation  ensures every enum field will have an explicit integer value assigned to it. Insertions can be "in between" (maintains readability) but the next available unused integer value would be used for the new insertions. Thus, once an integer is assigned to an enum field, it does not change with spec revision thereby not breaking warmboot.

### Update SAI_ACL_TABLE_ATTR_ENTRY_LIST value

This enhancement is for setting up of value to 0x2000 which will allow future expansion of acl table fields without changing attr values after SAI_ACL_TABLE_ATTR_FIELD_END. This is upadated in saiacl.h as below.

````````````````

     *
     * Packet is dropped due to local SID configuration or incorrect value in SRV6 packet header
     * e.g.: Local SID packet action is set to SAI_PACKET_ACTION_DROP
     * Next Header is SRH and Segments Left value is 0 for End, End.X, End.T, End.B* endpoint types
     * Next Header is not SRH while local SID is configured for packet DA
     * Segments Left value is not 0 when received packet is destined to S and S is a local SID of type End.D*
