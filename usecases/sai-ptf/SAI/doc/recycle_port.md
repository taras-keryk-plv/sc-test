This spec talks about the Recycle port usecases.

It is helpful in certain scenarios for packets that have gone through a full 
switch pipeline to be re-injected into the beginning (Ingress) of the pipeline.
SONiC on a disaggregated VOQ chassis uses this capability. There are other examples.
Currently this can only be done via SAI by putting a port in loopback configuration.
But this takes a port away from regular network traffic. What is needed is a
dedicated Recycle port. Such a port must be treated like a regular network port
for all ASIC programming purposes (routing, bridging, ACL, queuing, tunnels, 
mirroring â€¦). The only exception would be that it does not need to support some 
MAC layer functions.


A new generic port type for Recycle port is defined. The header mode is Ethernet
by default. Spec need to be updated for new header type for future applications.

```
/**
 * @brief Attribute data for #SAI_PORT_ATTR_TYPE
 */
typedef enum _sai_port_type_t
{
    /** Actual port. N.B. Different from the physical port. */
    SAI_PORT_TYPE_LOGICAL,

    /** CPU Port */
    SAI_PORT_TYPE_CPU,

    /** Fabric Port */
    SAI_PORT_TYPE_FABRIC,

    /** Recycle Port */
    SAI_PORT_TYPE_RECYCLE,

} sai_port_type_t;
```

SAI Adapter is expected to 
* Send Port oper status (UP) notification for the recycle port

### Usecase 1: Inband communication in VoQ System
Details are available at [VoQ HLD](https://github.com/Azure/SONiC/blob/master/doc/voq/voq_hld.md#251-inband-recycle-port-option)<br>
In this case L3 RIF, Neighbor are created on recycle port just like on SAI_PORT_TYPE_LOGICAL


### Usecase 2: Everflow - ERSPAN Monitor port is located on remote ASIC
In this case for Recycle port object id will be used for attribute SAI_MIRROR_SESSION_ATTR_MONITOR_PORT<br>
Before adding a ERSPAN session in local ASIC
* Add the necessary L3 RIF, Neighbor and Nexthop are created in the remote ASIC
* Add the corresponding RIF for remote system port, neighbor and nexthop in local ASIC
